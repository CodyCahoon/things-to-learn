1. What is shadow DOM and how is it used?

```
Shadow DOM is a DOM structure attached to an element (called the shadow host) to enapsulate its own DOM tree. A shadow tree is not affected by outside CSS. Benefits to using shadow DOM are encapsulating markup and styling for an element, cons can be unable to parse shadow DOM since its outside of the DOM and style isolation causes global styles to not work within this shadow DOM (this can be fixed by importing a global style sheet inside the shadow DOM)
